NOTE: This service references shared models under `services/shared/models/*` which should be created or linked.

Expected models used by reports-service:
- `shared/models/submission` - submissions collection schema
- `shared/models/enrollment` - student enrollments
- `shared/models/course` - class/course metadata

You can either create a `services/shared` package or duplicate minimal model files into this service.
